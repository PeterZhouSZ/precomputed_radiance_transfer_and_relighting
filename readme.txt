First, execute "GenerateLightTransportMatrix.exe" (or "GenerateLightTransportMatrixGeometryRelighting.exe" for geometry relighting). Once the process is complete, 18 files (ltm_ir, ltm_ig, ltm_ib (i=1-6)), each of which stores the corresponding light transport matrix, will be created in the directory "data". Note that this will take several hours and require large disk space (more than 20GB). Then, execute "RealtimeRendering.exe" (or "RealtimeRenderingGeometryRelighting.exe). For image religting, if you run "RealtimeRendering.exe" with argument "1", you can quantize and dither the entries of the light transport matrix.
